## Faculty of Engineering

The mission of the Faculty of Engineering is to educate individuals for careers of leadership and innovation in industry, government and educational institutions, to expand the engineering knowledge base through original research, and to contribute through professional services towards a more prosperous and sustainable society. The vision of the Faculty of Engineering is to continue to employ the best faculty and to accept the best students and, thus, to become one of the leading engineering schools in the world in the areas of education, research and technology innovation. Our undergraduate programs are built on a sound foundation of freshman year core courses in engineering sciences including mathematics, physics, chemistry, economy, and computer programming, followed by engineering core courses mandated by the departments typically during sophomore and junior years, supplemented by specialization-option and complementary courses taken by the students during their junior and senior years. The undergraduate curricula of the engineering departments therefore comprise core courses in engineering sciences, departmental core courses, specialization-option courses, complementary courses, as well as courses in humanities and social sciences.
